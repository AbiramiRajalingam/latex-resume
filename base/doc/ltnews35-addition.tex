\subsection{Cleanup of the Unicode declaration interface}

When declaring encoding specific commands for the Unicode (TU)
encoding some declarations, such as \cs{DeclareUnicodeComposite} do
not have the encoding name as an explicit argument but use
\cs{UnicodeEncodingName} implicitly. Others, such as
\cs{DeclareUnicodeAccent} require it as an explicit argument.  This
inconsistency has now been removed and the encoding name is always
implicit. To avoid a breaking change for a few packages on CTAN
\cs{DeclareUnicodeAccent} still accepts three arguments if the second
argument is \texttt{TU} or \cs{UnicodeEncodingName}. Once all packages
have been updated this code branch will get removed.
