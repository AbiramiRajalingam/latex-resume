\section{Hook business}

After the introduction of the hook management system in the 2020
release of \LaTeX{}~\cite{34:ltnews32} package developers have started
to make more and more use of the new functionality. This resulted in a
number of queries showing that some of the documentation was not
precise enough and that one or the other clarification was
needed. This has now been addressed in the documentation. The extended
usage also showed a small number of deficiencies that we thought
should be corrected now while the adoption rate is still relatively
small. These are addressed in this release and documented below.


\subsection{Providing \cs{ActivateGenericHook}}

The hook management system offers a number of generic hooks, i.e.,
hooks whose names contain a variable component, for example the name
of an environment. Predeclaring such hooks as not really feasible
which is why these hooks use a different mechanism: they are
implicitly available end spring into life the moment a package or the
user in the preamble adds cde to them using \cs{AddToHook}.  The
kernel offers such hooks for environments \texttt{env/...}, commands
\texttt{cmd/...}, and files, package or classes, \texttt{file/...},
\texttt{include/...}, \texttt{package/...}, and \texttt{class/...}.

It is possible to offer generic hooks in packages, e.g., if you have
hooks that depend on the current language and therefore need the
language name as part of the hook name and you don't know all possible
names beforehand.

If you want to offer your generic hooks you do this by using
\cs{UseHook} or \cs{UseOneTimeHook} in your (package) code, but
\emph{without declaring the hook} with \cs{NewHook}. Without any
further work a call to \cs{UseHook} with an undeclared hook name does
nothing. So as an additional setup step, it is necessary to explicitly
activate the generic hook with \cs{ActivateGenericHook}.\footnote{Note
  that in the previous release we offered \cs{ProvideHook} as a means
  to achieve this effect, but the name was badly chosen so we decided
  to deprecate it and now offer \cs{ActivateGenericHook} instead
  because that is what it is meant for.}

Assuming
that you don't know all the different hook names up front it will
remain the task of the users of your package to activate the hook
themselves before adding code to it. For example, Babel offers hooks
such as \texttt{babel/afterextras/\meta{language}} enabling the user
to add language specific declarations there. They can then write
\begin{verbatim}
\ActivateGenericHook
          {babel/afterextras/ngerman}
\AddToHook{babel/afterextras/ngerman}
          {\color{blue}}
\end{verbatim}
after which all German words would be colored blue in the text.

Note that a generic hook produced in this way is always a normal hook.




\subsection{Clear extra hook code for next invocation}

There are a few use cases where it would be helpful if one can cancel
an earlier use of \cs{AddToHookNext}, for example, when a page is
discarded with \cs{DiscardShipoutBox} because only some pages of the
document are printed. For such situations the new command
\cs{ClearHookNext} is provided.
%
\githubissue{565}



\subsection{Class, package, and include hook improvements}

Classes, packages and include files can only be loaded once in a
\LaTeX{} document. For that reasons hooks that are specific to such
files have been made one-time hooks. Beside being more efficient this
supports the following important use case
\begin{verbatim}
\AddToHook{package/varioref/after}
  { ... apply my customizations if the package
      gets loaded (or was loaded already) ... }
\end{verbatim}
without the need to first test if the package was already loaded
before.
%
\githubissue{623}


\subsection{Changed how \cs{RemoveFromHook} treats code that isn't in the hook}

In the first version of \cs{RemoveFromHook}, in case the code label
being removed didn't exist in the hook, a ``removal order'' would be
queued, and the next time something tried to add that label to the hook,
the \cs{AddToHook} would be cancelled by the removal order, and no code
would be added that once.  This was so that in principle package loading
order wouldn't matter.  However this implementation didn't work quite as
intended, because while two \cs{AddToHook} to a given label would be
removed by a single \cs{RemoveFromHook}, one \cs{RemoveFromHook} could
not cancel two \cs{AddToHook} to that label, and this asymmetry caused
confusion and was a recipe for further problems.

The implementation was changed and now \cs{RemoveFromHook} only removes
labels that already exist in a hook, and will display a warning if they
don't.  For usage across packages, for removing code in a hook, the
\texttt{voids} relation should be used instead:  this relation is
non-destructive (meaning it can be later reverted with another one), and
it is truly independent of package loading order, so it should be
preferred.

\section{New or improved commands}


\subsection{Added \cs{PackageNote} and \cs{ClassNote}}

\LaTeX{} offers \cs{PackageError} to signal errors that stop
processing, \cs{PackageWarning} that generates a warning message on the
terminal, but continues with the processing and also \cs{PackageInfo}
to provide some information that is only written to the \texttt{.log}
file. What hasn't existed up to now is a way to provide some
information on the terminal that is identifying itself as coming from
a specific package but which isn't claiming to be a warning. Thus,
packages that wanted to write to the terminal used \cs{PackageWarning}
even though the information wasn't really warning the user.  For this
we now have \cs{PackageNote} and \cs{PackageNoteNoLine}, that identify
themselves as \enquote{informational}, but still go to the terminal and
not only to the transcript.

Similar commands exist for classes and there we have added the missing
\cs{ClassNote} and \cs{ClassNoteNoLine} as well.
%
\githubissue{613}


\subsection{New implementation for \cs{counterwithin}}

New implementation for \cs{counterwithout} and \cs{counterwithin} with
an additional optional arg so it becomes a drop-in replacement for
amsmath \cs{numberwithin}.

\emph{write appropriate description}



\subsection{New default for \cs{tracinglostchars}}

In 2021 the \TeX{} engines got enhanced so that \cs{tracinglostchars}
is now also supporting the value \texttt{3}, turning missing
characters into errors and not just warnings. This change made us
realize that \LaTeX{} should use a better default for this parameter
(so far the warning was only written to the transcript file).
Using the now available \texttt{3} would really be the best, but for
compatibility reasons we only set it to \texttt{2} in the kernel.
However, we recommend adding \cs{tracinglostchars}\texttt{=3} to the
preamble of documents, because missing glyphs in the output are an
error and should therefore be properly looked at.






\subsection{Provide tests for package and class loading}

To test if a package was loaded you can now use \cs{IfPackageLoadedTF}
\Arg{package} \Arg{true} \Arg{false} and based on the result execute
different code. It is also possible to check if the package was loaded
with certain options. This is done with
\cs{IfPackageLoadedWithOptionsTF}. It takes four arguments:
\Arg{package}\Arg{option-list}\Arg{true}\Arg{false}. It uses the
\meta{false} code if at least one option in the \meta{option-list}
has not been used during loading or if the package hasn't been loaded
at all.

For classes similar commands (\texttt{Package} replaced by
\texttt{Class} in the name) are provided.
%
\githubissue{621}









\subsection{New \cs{showfloat} command}

The package \pkg{fltrace} offers a (fairly low-level but very
detailed) way to trace \LaTeX's float mechanism. This can help to
understand why a certain float is placed into a certain region or why
it shows up unexpectedly on a later page.  \LaTeX{} stores floats in
registers named \cs{bx@A}, \cs{bx@B}, etc., and these names show up in
the tracing information.
%
To display their contents you can now say
\verb=\showfloat{=\textit{uc-letter}\verb=}= where \textit{uc-letter}
is the uppercase letter (or letters) after \texttt{bx@} in the
register name shown in the tracing. The command is generally
available, whether or not you have loaded \pkg{fltrace}, because it is
also useful when interpreting the tracing output of the
\pkg{fewerfloatpages} package.

\section{Code improvements}


\subsection{Additional Extended Latin characters predefined}
Some additional characters such as \'k (U+1E131) are now pre-defined and
will work without needing \verb|\DeclareUnicodeCharacter| declarations.
%
\githubissue{593}


\subsection{Use OpenType version of Latin Modern Upright Italic}
When Latin Modern is used with the TU encoding under \XeTeX\ or \LuaTeX\
and fontshape \texttt{ui} is requested, \LaTeX\ now uses the OpenType
version instead of substituting the (T1 encoded) Type 1 version.


\subsection{Pick up all arguments to \cs{contentsline}}

The \cs{contentsline} commands in the TOC file are always followed by
four arguments, the last one being empty by default and only used by
\pkg{hyperref}. The \cs{contentsline} command itself only used the
first three arguments and relied on the fourth being empty (and thus
doing no harm). But this assumption is not always correct, e.g., if
you use \pkg{hyperref} and then remove it from the preamble.

So now we pick up all four arguments and save the last one away, so
that it can be used by \pkg{hyperref}.
%
\githubissue{633}


\subsection{Fix dropping math lists in \LuaTeX\ callbacks}

The \LuaTeX\ callbacks \texttt{pre\_mlist\_to\_hlist\_filter}
and \texttt{post\_mlist\_to\_hlist\_filter} no longer create an error if
the callback handler indicates to remove the entire math block.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Replicate argument processors for all embellishments}

There was a bug in \pkg{ltcmd} (former \pkg{xparse}) that caused
commands to misbehave if they were defined with embellishments and
argument processors.  In that case, only one (possibly void) argument
processor would be added to the full set of embellishment arguments,
resulting in too few processors in some cases, leading to unpredictable
behavior.  This bug has been fixed by applying the same argument
processors to all the embellishments in a set, so a declaration like:
\begin{verbatim}
\NewDocumentCommand\foo{>{\TrimSpaces}e{_^}}
  {(#1)[#2]}
\foo^{ a }_{ b }
\end{verbatim}
will now correctly apply \cs{TrimSpaces} to both arguments.

\githubissue{000}



\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{tools} category}

\subsection{\pkg{varioref}: Improve missing label handling}

If an undefined label is referenced, \pkg{varioref} makes a default
definition so that later processing finds the right structure (two
brace groups inside \cs{r@}\meta{label}) However, if \pkg{nameref} or
\pkg{hyperref} is loaded, the data structure changes to five
arguments, resulting in low-evel errors in some cases. The code has
been changed to avoid these errors.
%
\sxissue{603948}


\subsection{\pkg{array}: Cancel  \cs{mathsurround} for \env{tabular}}

A \env{tabular} environment is internally typeset as an \env{array}
environment with special settings and therefore in math mode. This
math group should not get any \cs{mathsuround} added as it isn't a
real formula because otherwise the spacing around the \env{tabular}
changes. This bug has been there forever (which means not many people
use \cs{mathsurround} or noticed the difference). Anyhow, this now got
fixed.
