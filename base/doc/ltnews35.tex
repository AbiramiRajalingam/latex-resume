\section{Introduction}


\section{New or improved commands}

\subsection{Floating point and integer calculations}

The L3 programming layer offers expandable commands for calculating
floating point and integer values, but so far these functions have
only been available to programmers, because they require
\cs{ExplSyntaxOn} to be in force. To make them easily available at the
document-level, the small package \pkg{xfp} defined \cs{fpeval} and
\cs{inteval}.


An example of use could be the following:
\begin{verbatim}
\LaTeX{} can now compute: 
\[ \frac{\sin (3.5)}{2} + 2\cdot 10^{-3}
    = \fpeval{sin(3.5)/2 + 2e-3}         \]
\end{verbatim}
which produces the following output:
\begin{quote}
\LaTeX{} can now compute: 
\[ \frac{\sin (3.5)}{2} + 2\cdot 10^{-3}
   = \fpeval{sin(3.5)/2 + 2e-3}         \]
\end{quote}
These two commands have now been moved into the kernel and in addition
we also provide \cs{dimeval} and \cs{skipeval}. The details of their
syntax are described in \file{usrguide3.pdf}.  The command \cs{fpeval}
offers a rich syntax allows for extensive calculations whereas the
other three commands are essentially thin wrappers for \cs{numexpr},
\cs{dimexpr}, and \cs{glueexpr} \Dash therefore inheriting some syntax
peculiars and limitations in expressiveness.
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand\calulateheight[1]{%
  \setlength\textheight{\dimeval{\topskip 
        + \baselineskip * \inteval{#1-1}}}}
\end{verbatim}
The above, for example, calculates the appropriate \cs{textheight} for
a given number of text lines.

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{\class{ltxdoc} gets a \option{nocfg} option}

The \LaTeX{} sources are formatted with the \class{ltxdoc} class,
which supports loading a local config file \file{ltxdoc.cfg}. In the
past the \LaTeX{} sources used such a file but it was not distributed.
As a result reprocessing the \LaTeX{} sources elsewhere showed
formatting changes.  We now distribute this file which means that it
is loaded by default. With the option \option{nocfg} this can be
prevented.


\subsection{\pkg{doc} upgraded to version~3}

After roughly three decades the \pkg{doc} package gets a cautious
uplift, as already announced at the TUG conference 2019\Dash changes
to \pkg{doc} are obviously always done in a leisurely manner.

Given that most documentation is nowadays viewed on screen,
\pkg{hyperref} support is added and by default enabled (suppress it
with option \option{nohyperref} or alternatively with
\option{hyperref}\texttt{=false}) so the internal cross-reference are
properly resolved including those from the index back into the
document.

Furthermore, \pkg{doc} has now a general mechanism to define
additional \enquote{doc} elements besides the two \texttt{Macro} and
\texttt{Env} it did know in the past. This enables better
documentation because you can now clearly mark different types of
objects instead of simply calling them all \enquote{macros}.
If desired, they can be collected together under a heading
in the index so that you have a section just with your document
interface commands, or with all parameters, or \ldots

The code borrows ideas from Didier Verna's \pkg{dox} package (although
the document level interface is different) and it makes use of Heiko
Oberdiek's \pkg{hypdoc} package, which at some point in the future
will be completely integrated, given that its whole purpose it to
patch \pkg{doc}'s internal commands to make them \pkg{hyperref}-aware.

All changes are expected to be upward compatible, but if you run into
issues with older documentation using \pkg{doc} a simple and quick
solution is to load the package as follows:
\verb/\usepackage{doc}[=v2]/


\subsection{Lua\TeX\ callback improvements}

The Lua\TeX\ callbacks \texttt{hpack\_quality} and \texttt{vpack\_quality} are
now \texttt{exclusive} and therefore only allow a single handler.
The previous type \texttt{list} resulted in incorrect parameters when multiple
handlers were set, therefore this only makes an existing restriction more
explicit.

Additionally the return value \texttt{true} for \texttt{list}
callbacks is now handled internally and no longer passed on to the
engine. This simplifies the handling of these callbacks and makes it
easier to provide consistent interfaces for user defined \texttt{list}
callbacks.

\subsection{Class \class{proc} supports \option{twoside}}

The document class \class{proc}, which is a small variation on the
\class{article} class, now supports the \option{twoside} option
displaying different data in the footer line on recto and verso pages.

\subsection{Croatian character support}
%
The default \pkg{inputenc} support has been extended to support the 9 characters
D\v Z, D\v z, d\v z, LJ, Lj, lj, NJ, Nj, nj, input as single UTF-8 codepoints
in the range U+01C4 to U+01CC.

The recently added \cs{newcolumn} didn't work properly if used in
vertical mode, where it behaved like \cs{columnbreak}, i.e., spreading
the column material out instead running the column short.
