\section{Code improvements}

\emph{to write}

\githubissue{943}




\subsection{Displaying release information in the \texttt{.log}}

\LaTeX{} displays its release information at the very beginning of the
\LaTeX{} run on the terminal and also writes it to the transcript file
if that is already opened at this point. While this is normally true,
it is not the case if the \LaTeX{} run was started passing additional
\TeX{} code on the command line, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex '\PassOptionsToClass{11pt}{article}
              \input{myarticle}'
\end{verbatim}
In this case the release information is displayed when
\cs{PassOptionsToClass} is processed but the transcript file is only
opened when the output file name is known, i.e., after \cs{input} has
been seen, and as a result the release information is only shown on
the terminal.

To account for this scenario, we now repeat the release information
also at the very end of the transcript file where we can be sure that
it is open and ready to receive material.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Incompatibility between \pkg{doc} and \pkg{unicode-math}}

The \pkg{unicode-math} package alters the catcode of \verb=|= but does
not adjust its value for use in \pkg{doc}, with the result that
\enquote{or} module, i.e., $\langle A | B \rangle$ are displayed in a
strange way. This is now fixed with some firstaid code that will
eventually be moved into \pkg{unicode-math}.
