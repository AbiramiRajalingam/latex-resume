\section{Handling paragraph continuation}

Already \LaTeX~2.09 offered some automatism to detect whether or not
text after a list or some other display environment is meant to be a
continuation of the current paragraph or should start a new one.  The
document-level syntax for this is that a blank line after such an
environment signals to \LaTeX{} that it should start a new paragraph; the
absense signals that there should be no paragraph indentation and the
text should be considered a continuation.

Unfortunately, there are a number of cases where the original 2.09
approach failed, e.g., with
\begin{flushleft}
  \ttfamily
\{\meta{local customizations}\\
\cs{begin}\{equation\} a<b \cs{end}\{equation\}\} \\
\meta{some text}
\end{flushleft}
the \meta{some text} incorrectly started a new paragraph.  Bug reports
about this behavior can be traced back to the time \LaTeXe{} was
developed, e.g., one test file from 1992 has a note that the above
case was unfortunately not resolvable with some improvements made back
then.  The main cause of the issue (as you probably guessed) is that
the mechanism failed whenever the environment was executed within a
group (\texttt{\{...\}}, \cs{begingroup}/\cs{endgroup}, or
\cs{bgroup}/\cs{egroup} pair that was closed before the next blank
line was reached.

While this could be most of the time visually corrected by adding some
explicit \cs{noindent} the situation got worse when one tried to
implement tagged PDFs resulting in incorrect structures or worse.

We therefore made a new attempt to resolve this problem in every
situation and this new solution is now rolled out in the current
release.

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{Avoiding keyval option clashes between classes and packages}

In \LaTeX{} News~35~\cite{40:ltnews35} we introduced keyval option processing
to the kernel. Following the standard for \LaTeXe{} options, keyval options
given to the \cs{documentclass} line were treated as global and so parsed by
every package. However, with keyvals, the likelihood of a name clash between a
class-specific option and one used by a package is much higher than it is with
simple strings. We have therefore refined the mechanism in the current release.

When a class uses the kernel keyval processor, any options it recognises are
recorded and any packages using the keyval processor will then \emph{skip}
these \enquote{global} options. To allow for the case where a class directly
uses an option which should be global (for example \texttt{draft}), a new key
property \texttt{.pass-to-packages} has been added. This can then be set to
indicate that this key is not to be skipped. For example
\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareKeys{
  draft .if = {ifl@cls@draft},
  draft .pass-to-packages = true,
  mode  .store = \cls@mode
}
\end{verbatim}
in a class would create two options, \texttt{draft} and \texttt{mode}. The
\texttt{draft} option will be treated in the normal way by packages using
keyvals, but they will ignore the \texttt{mode} option: it is effectively
marked as \enquote{private} to the class.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Fix wrong file type in a rollback warning}

When \LaTeX{} is rolled back to date \meta{date1} and a class or
package with minimum date requirement \meta{date2} is to be loaded, a
rollback warning is raised if \meta{date2} is later than \meta{date1}:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Warning: Suspicious rollback/min-date date given
               A minimal date of YYYY-MM-DD has been specified for package
               '<pkgname>'.
               But this is in conflict with a rollback request to YYYY-MM-DD.
\end{verbatim}

In some cases this message showed a wrong file type, i.e.,
\verb|document class '<pkgname>'| or \verb|package '<clsname>'|.
This has now been corrected.

\subsection{\pkg{doc}:\ \cs{PrintDescribeMacro} in preamble}

In \pkg{doc} version 2 it was possible alter the definition of
\cs{PrintDescribeMacro} and similar commands in preamble. In version 3
this stopped working because they go reset at the end of the
preamble. This has now been implemented differently and changes in the
preamble are possible again.

\section{Improvement to \XeTeX\ \cs{showhyphens}}
When using \cs{showhyphens} with \XeTeX, missing character warnings
would be generated for any character not in Latin Modern. This has been
corrected and the warnings are suppressed.
