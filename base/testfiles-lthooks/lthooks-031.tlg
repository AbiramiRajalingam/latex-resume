! LaTeX hooks Error: Cannot set a sorting rule for the already used hook
(hooks)              'aaaa'.
(hooks)              Try setting this rule earlier.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...\hook_use_once:n {aaaa}
You tried to set the ordering of hook 'aaaa' using
  \DeclareHookRule{aaaa}{A}{before}{B}
but hook 'aaaa' was already used as a one-time hook, thus sorting is no longer
possible. Try using this command before the hook is used.
