\section{Changes to the \LaTeX{} kernel}


\subsection{Guard against \cs{unskip} at the start of a tabular cell}

If a \env{tabular} or \env{array} cell started with command that
issued an \cs{unskip} as its first action centering the column got
broken because the space on the left got removed. This got corrected
by adding a minusule additional space after the stretching space that
could be safely removed in such a case without beig noticable.

This change was also applied in the \pkg{array} package.

\githubissue{102}


\subsection{Fixes to Unicode table data}

\texttt{U+012F} which is \enquote{i with ogonek} should produce an
\enquote{i} and not a\enquote{dotless i}. This has been corrected.

\githubissue{122}

the Unicode slots \texttt{27E8} and \texttt{27E9} have been mapped to
\cs{textlangle} and \cs{textrangle} which is the recommended mapping.

\githubissue{110}

\subsection{Improve \cs{InputIfFileExists}'s handling of fie names}

In rare circumstances it was possible that \cs{InputIfFileExists}
would work incorrectly, e.g., a cnstruction such as
\begin{verbatim}
\InputIfFileExists{foo}{\input{bar}}{}
\end{verbatim}
Would not load the files \texttt{foo.tex} and \texttt{bar.tex} but
would load \texttt{foo.tex} twice. This has been corrected.

\githubissue{109}


\subsection{Improve wording of a warning message}

\githubissue{107}


\subsection{\pkg{nfssfont}: Generate a font table as the default action}

With the small file \texttt{nfssfont.tex} it is possible to produce
font tables and other font tests in the style set up by Don Knuth. As
in nearly all cases producing a font table is the desired action this
action has been made the default so that one can simply hit enter
instead of having to write \verb=\table\bye=.





        
\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{tools} category}

\subsection{\pkg{multicol}: Introduce \texttt{minrows} counter for balancing}

When there are only a few lines of text on a page at the end of a
\env{multicols} environment balancing them looks rather odd, e.g., if
you then end up with three columns each containing a single line. This
can now be controlled through the counter \texttt{minrows} (default is
1) which requires at least that many lines in the first column during
balancing. Thus, if you set it to \texttt{2} one would get a
distribution of \texttt{2+1+0} lines and if set it to three, the result
would have been \texttt{3+0+0} instead of the default \texttt{1+1+1}.

What is most appropriate really depends on the circumstances, but this
now gives you the tools to make local or global adjustements.
