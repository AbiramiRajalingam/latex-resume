Documentation for the LaTeX kernel
==================================

Release 2019-10-01 pre-release 1

Overview
--------

This bundle provides the core documentation supporting the LaTeX kernel.

For historical reasons, the base distribution and the core documentation
are bundled separately. Documentation is found in the `doc` bundle. In an
installed TeX system, `base` and `doc` should be placed within the same
location; the distinction is therefore primarily of importance when looking
at the development code.
