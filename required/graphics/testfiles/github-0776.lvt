% If a file 'meow.ps' exists in folder-a and 'meow.tex' exists
% in folder-b, and if a graphics file 'meow' (no extension) is
% requested we have to make sure that the actual graphics file
% is found instead of the .tex file (that may be found because
% TeX assumes the .tex extension if no extension was given...)
