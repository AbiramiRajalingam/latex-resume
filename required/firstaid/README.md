# LaTeX2e-temporary-external-fixes
LaTeX2e kernel code that temporarily adjusts packages that are not yet updated and therefore fail.

This is stored in a separate file external to the base bundle, so that it can be easily updated when fixes become available without the need to upload a full new LaTeX2e release to CTAN.
