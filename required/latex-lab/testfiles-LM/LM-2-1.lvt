\START

\section*{ToDos}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Paragraphs: should be fine, but we should provide a documentation on
  how we tag them (using \verb=<text-unit><text>=).
\item
  Decide how to handle quotes
\item
  Produce ActualText for logos
\item
  Decide how to handle emphasis (and implement)
\item
  Line breaks: what is need here if anything?
\item
  Footnotes: are we good? Not really: \verb=\footnotetext= is not (no longer?) long!
\item
  Formulas: add examples (should be fine)
\end{itemize}

\section{Input}

\subsection{Sentences and Paragraphs}

\kant[1][1]


\subsubsection{Quotation Marks}

Quote test: ``\kant*[1][2]'' and some more text.
and `\kant*[1][3]' even more.

\subsubsection{Simple Text-Generating Commands}

Some people use plain \TeX, but I prefer \LaTeX\ instead.

This page was produced \today.

If nominated \ldots, I will not serve.


\subsubsection{Emphasizing Text}

\LaTeX{} offers \emph{one command} and {\em one declaration} for emphasis.

What are we going to do with \textbf{strong} aka bold face?

\subsubsection{Preventing Line Breaks}

Anything to do here? If so, what for Mr.~Jones and Figure~7


\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes\footnote{Like this one} should be fine, as well as simple footnote marks\footnotemark{}
with the text being supplied later.

\footnotetext{The one for the mark. For good measure have a second paragraph.\endgraf \kant*[1][4]}

Question is: is this placed correctly?

\subsubsection{Formulas}

They should be fine too (and tested elsewhere).
