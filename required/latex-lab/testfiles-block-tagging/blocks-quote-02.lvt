\section{Display quotation in text}

In the \TeX{}book Don Knuth wrote
\begin{quote}
  Computer system manuals usually make a dull reading, but take a
  heart: This one contains JOKES every once in a while, so you might
  actually enjoy reading it.

  (However, most of the jokes can only be appreciated properly if you
  understand a technical point that is being made---so read
  carefully.)
\end{quote}
and continues with
\begin{quote}
  Another noteworthy characteristic of this manual is that it doesn't always tell the truth.
\end{quote}
and indeed both statements are true.

\subsection*{Commentary}

\begin{em}
  The above is clearly a single sentence with two quotes inside, which
  contain full sentences in their own right and with longer quotes the
  quote itself could contain several paragraphs (like the first).

  This can't be adequately represented just with \struct{P} and
  \struct{BlockQuote} structures because of the fact that \struct{P}s
  can't be nested. Just using \struct{P} and \struct{BlockQuote}
  without nesting means that you do not in way indicate that the
  single outer sentence forms a unit.

  In the last LWG meeting I presented an approach in which the whole
  sentence was tagged with a single \struct{P} and the display quotes
  where all wrapped in \struct{Figure}s (allowed inside \struct{P})
  and in there in a \struct{BlockQuote}. However, as it was pointed
  out last time, the downside of that approach is that most processors
  would not consider a figure as a textual object and would
  require/expect alternate text (which would make little sense)


  We now solve this in \LaTeX{} differently by introducing adding a
  \struct{tpara} (text paragraph) structure (rollmapped to
  \struct{Part}. This way we can represent the outer sentence as a
  single \struct{tpara} (indicating what belongs together) and the
  components as \struct{P}s and \struct{BlockQuotes}s.

  Note however, that splitting the single sentences into three
  \struct{P}s plus two \struct{BockQuote}s somewhat violates PDF/UA-2,
  because according to that standard a sentence should be represented
  in a single \struct{P}, while the solution with \struct{Figure}
  violates requirements for alternative text, boundingbox, etc. So
  there is some unresolved issue here if real world examples are to be
  represented.
